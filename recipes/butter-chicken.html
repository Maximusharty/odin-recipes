    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, you may notice that 
        Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani â€” chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala.</p>
    <p>Prepared in a buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. Most restaurants are known to add in copious amounts of butter, 
        which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick of grease.</p>
